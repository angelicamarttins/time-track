## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Type checker
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this project, I used  TypeScript for the first time, which make me understand the importance of a type checker. With TypeScript it's possible to understand what type we are waiting to receive and what we'll return. This kind of understanding, allows us to code more freely, since we'll have automatic checking for each change. 
Besides TypeScript, I used Styled Components for the first time and I'm very impressive because we can continue to work with the idea of components - and not class anymore - and gain the all the benefits and resources of JavaScript to use in CSS. 

### Continued development

In my conception, I need to understand better some hooks, like useMemo and useCallback. In some parts of this project, I think I could have use some React hooks, not only this I mentioned. Other things I need to understand better is how to type some props in different contexts. 

### Useful resources

- [TypeScript Casting]([https://www.example.com](https://www.w3schools.com/typescript/typescript_casting.php#:~:text=There%20are%20times%20when%20working,process%20of%20overriding%20a%20type.) - This helped me to make TypeScript understand a string as a property of a enum.
